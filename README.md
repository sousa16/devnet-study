# DevNet Study (DEVASC)

This repository is dedicated to my studies for the **Cisco Certified DevNet Associate (DEVASC)** certification.  
I’m following the [O’Reilly DevNet Associate course](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/cisco-certified-devnet/9780136904410/) and will use this repository to collect:

- 📚 Useful resources for revision

## 🚀 Goal
Document my learning journey and build hands-on experience with:
- Network automation
- APIs and Python programming
- Cisco platforms
- Cloud, DevOps, and infrastructure automation
- Networking fundamentals
